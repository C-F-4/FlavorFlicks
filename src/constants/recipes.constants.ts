      steps: "1. Prepare the Shrimp:\
        \
        Start by grilling the shrimp tails. Brush them lightly with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.\
        2. Grill the Shrimp:\
        \
        Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Place the shrimp tails on the grill and cook for approximately 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they turn pink and slightly charred.\
        3. Poach the Chicken:\
        \
        While the shrimp is grilling, cut the chicken breast into square pieces. In a separate pan, melt the unsalted butter over low heat.\
        Add the chicken pieces to the pan and poach them gently in the butter until they are fully cooked, tender, and golden brown. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.\
        4. Assemble the Salad:\
        \
        Arrange the fresh lettuce on a serving plate. Drizzle with a touch of olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper.\
        5. Final Touch:\
        \
        Once the shrimp and chicken are ready, carefully place the grilled shrimp on top of the bed of lettuce.\
        Arrange the butter-poached chicken squares alongside the shrimp.\
        6. Serve and Enjoy:\
        \
        Your Shrimp Delight is now ready to be savored. Serve it immediately and experience the delightful fusion of flavors and textures.\
